# Hi

> 
My website comes from [onevcat](https://onevcat.com/)'s **Blog**. 

This is just the beginning, I will continue to improve the content of the blog, although not yet reached a certain extent, but I believe that this will leave a programmer growth trajectory.

If you find an error in the article, you can open an **issuse**,  I will modify it.

**I will not stop learning, whether from the video, the book or other blog, if the article quoted in a person's text, I will be explained and thanks.**

## About this site

### Vno - Jekyll
